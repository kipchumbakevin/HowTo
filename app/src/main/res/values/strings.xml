    <string name="broker">An insurance broker sells, solicits, or negotiates insurance for compensation.
    An insurance broker is a professional who represents consumers in their search for the best insurance policy for their needs. They work closely with their clients to research coverage, terms, conditions, and price and then recommend the insurance policy that best fits the bill.
        Unlike captive and independent agents, who represent one or more insurance companies, a broker’s primary duty is to the client.\n
     Most commissions are between 2 and 8% of premiums, depending on state regulations. Brokers sell all types of insurance, including health insurance, homeowner insurance, accident insurance, life insurance, and annuities.</string>
    <string name="agent">An insurance agent is a professional who sells an insurance company’s products to consumers for a commission. An agent helps consumers select the right insurance to buy, but represents the insurance company in the transaction.

        Captive agents typically represent only one insurer.\n
        Independent insurance agents typically represent more than one insurer.\n
        Both captive and independent agents work on commission and can execute an insurance transaction from start to finish.\n
     agent might earn a 15 percent commission on general liability policies and a 10 percent commission on workers compensation policies. If your purchases a liability policy for a $2,000 premium, you will collect $2,000 from him/her, retain $300 in commission, and send the remaining $1,700 to your insurance company.</string>

        cryptographic puzzle and submitting it for other miners to confirm and come to a
        trustless consensus on each transaction that hits the blockchain.</string>
    <string name="ecommerce">eCommerce sites have exploded in popularity in recent years. With the prevalence of platforms like WordPress and WooCommerce, creating an eCommerce site couldn’t be easier.\n
    There are two different methods of running a successful online store:\n
Creating and selling a niche physical product to a dedicated group of buyers\n
Purchasing cheaper goods manufactured in foreign countries, repackaging them, and selling them at a markup.\n
    The first approach can be very successful, but it does require a passion for the product and the willingness to do a ton of research, product development, and testing.
    \nIf the first approach seems a little risky for your first online business, then you might consider the second option of reselling popular overseas products. This method involves sourcing a popular product from a platform like AliExpress, 
        repacking the product, and selling it through your own storefront.</string>
